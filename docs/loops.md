# Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code until required process is complete. Doing repetitive tasks is one of the main reason we love computer programms. The best example of loops in programming language is, your favourite song playing on repeat mode, we need our mobile to play the song until we say so to pause to stop it.

## while loop

    ```
    while smart_home_system_on = True:
        if time = 6pm:
            light_on = True
    ```

## for loop

    ```
    shopping_cart = ("phone, laptop, headphone")
    for product in shopping_cart:
        print(product)
    ```
