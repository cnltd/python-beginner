# Variables

Variables are what python uses to store values. When we create a variable, python reserve a storage space in the system memory. This memory size depedends on the data type that we store in a variable, we will learn more about data types in python below.

## Guidelines for naming variable
* Must always start with an alphabet or underscore symbol

'''
my_variable = 123
_myVariable = 123
'''

* They are case sensitive

'''
my_variable is not the same as My_variable or MY_VARIABLE
'''

* Can have numbers

'''
my_variable1
my variable200
'''

* Cannot contain symbols other than underscore, allowed range (a-z, 0-9 and _ )

'''
my_variable!, my_$variable2 and usage of other characters are not allowed
'''

* Cannot use python reserved words

'''
python has a list of reserved words like "class" and "def" which are not allowed to be used as variable name
'''

## Variable asignment
* Single assignment
'''
>>> my_number = 123
'''
* Multiple assignment
'''
>>> var1, var2, var3 = 1, 2, 3
>>> var4 = var5 = var6 = 456
'''
