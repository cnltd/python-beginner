# Conditions

Conditions are one of the key part of any programming language, we need condition structure to make decisions. For example, lets say we write a simple program to turn the street lights when its 6pm or a very complex one like google maps providing most suitable path to a detination while making decisions on traffic, road block, type of vehicle and much more, here the conditional statements helps us to do that.

## if Statement

    ```
    if time = 6pm:
        light_on = True
    ```

## if else Statement

    ```
    if traffic = True:
        delay += 5
    else:
        delay = 0
    ```

## if, elif Statement

    ```
    if lite_traffic = True:
        delay += 5
    elif medium_traffic = True:
        delay += 10
    elif heavy_traffic = True:
        delay += 15
    else:
        delay = 0
    ```
